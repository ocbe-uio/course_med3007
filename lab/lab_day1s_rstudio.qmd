## RStudio and Posit

RStudio is a free and open-source IDE (integrated development environment). RStudio IDE is developed by Posit, previously RStudio PBC. 

It is convenient to download RStudio to your laptop or desktop; or use RStudio Cloud (need internet connection). 

When you open Rstudio, you will see something like this.

## Empty bottom right panel

You might NOT see anything in the bottom right panel, because you might not have a *Project* yet. 

Don't worry, we will learn how to create it.
:::

# Create a new project 

You can use Rstudio *without* a `project`. However, it can help you navigating the workspace by 

* creating a folder 
* collecting your scripts and documentation

As a result, you can find things more easily, and do not need to set a path every time you open R.

Click the button on the top left, it allows you to **craete project**. We choose `New Directory`.

You need to give this project a name. We can call it `mf9130` for now. 

RStudio will also ask you where to put this project; you can put it somewhere easy to find.

Now you will see a new Rstudio session has been opened. At this point, you should be able to see the bottom right panel with a blue icon, with your specified project name.

# Navigate your project

The benefit of creating a project is that all your work (code, documentation, possibly datasets) is put in one place. 

::: callout-note
## Where to put your data

To keep things organized, people typically do one of the two things when it comes to data:

* store the data in the same folder as other related code and analysis (this is what we are showing now);
* store all the data from different studies together somewhere else, inside a `data` folder.

Both are good practices, as long as you stay organized.
:::

### Example: import data in Rstudio 

Assume that you have the following datasets:  

* `penguins_mini.csv` in the same folder as your `mf9130.Rproj`
* `penguins_mini_copy.csv` in the `data` folder, inside your project folder
  * we would refer to it as `data/penguins_mini_copy.csv` 
  * if you use windows system, it could look like `data\penguins_mini_copy.csv`.

In Rstudio project, you can see them presented in the same way that matches your folder.

To **load data within the Rstudio project**, you only need to call the *relative path* to the data: for example, `penguins_mini.csv` or `data/penguins_mini_copy.csv`

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Relative path

If your project called `/Users/your/project/location/proj`, and your data is located in `/Users/your/project/location/data/data.csv`, the relative path between the project and data is `data/data.csv`.
:::


To load data outside the project, you need to specify the *absolute path* in your system (looks like the last line below). It can be a bit annoying to do it everytime, so it might be a good idea to create a project!

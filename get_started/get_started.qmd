In this course we will be using R and Rstudio. You can either

-   (recommended) have **R and Rstudio installed on your laptop** 
-   or, use the PC in the PC lab here at the university

### Set up your RStudio on your laptop

You will need both R and Rstudio, they are two separate things. 

You can download **Rstudio** [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). In this page it will ask you to install R, so it should be clear to follow.

You can download **R** for Linux, macOS or Windows [here](https://cran.rstudio.com) or [here](https://cran.uib.no)

Once you have finished installing both R and Rstudio, open Rstudio, and you should be seeing something like this:

# Data

You can download the datasets from either our GitHub repository, or Canvas.

### Download data from Canvas

Log in your Canvas page, locate the dataset, and click "download".

### Download data from GitHub

The datasets used in this course are stored in this [folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/course_med3007/tree/main/lab/data).

1. Go to the repository, select the data you want to download by **left-click the file name**

2. If it is a dataset in `.csv, .txt` format, you will see something like this

<img src="fig_get_started_download2.png" align="center" width="600" /></a>

  * find **Raw** button, **right-click**, you will see a list of options
  * choose **Download Linked File**, this will download the data into your default download folder 
  * alternatively, choose **Download linked file as...** so that you can change where you put it and file name. 

3. If it is a dataset in `.dta, .xlsx` or other format, you might not see the data directly:

  * find **Download** button, left-click, and you will download it into your default download folder.


#### Optional: download data via URL

If you feel like it, you can also download data inside R via URL. You can read more about it [here](https://rpubs.com/lokraj/github_csv).




# Code

R scripts are stored in this [folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/course_med3007/tree/main/lab/code). 

To **download an R script**, it is similar to downloading a dataset

Alternatively, you can **create your own R script locally** inside Rstudio, by copy and paste the script from Github.
